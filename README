This is a simple library that can be used to generate images. The
images will contain a certain number of white "bugs", which are pixel
patterns placed randomly on a black background.

Type "make html" in the doc/ directory, which will create an html/
directory in the main directory of the package. You can point your
browser to the index.html page, or you can look at doc/index.txt
directly.

The package exports some premade datasets, like tetromino10x10 or
pentomino10x10. Both place three shapes (either tetrominos or
pentominos) in the image, two of them being the same and the third
being different. The task is to identify the image that's different.
