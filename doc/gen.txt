Scene generators
================

The ``bugland.gen`` module contains several scene generators for use
as the ``gen`` parameter of the :class:`Bugland` class.

Note that there is no formal class to derive from to make a scene
generator. What Bugland expects is mentioned in its documentation:
some object or function with ``nout`` and ``nclasses`` fields and that
can be called with (xres, yres) arguments to produce an iterator
yielding a scene description (a list of bugs with their positions) and
a target.
